/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/8288-274162-0064.wav,143404,ah said raoul snatching eagerly at the pen which the captain held out to him
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/8288-274162-0065.wav,128844,how very fortunate that is he was looking for you too
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/8288-274162-0066.wav,226124,she said in the same tone of voice it is not i who am going to speak to him who then
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0000.wav,150924,i accompany my granddaughter to this this entertainment her ladyship responded
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0001.wav,87404,it is scarcely a joyous occasion to my mind
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0002.wav,114124,no need to dress yourself like that if it isn't ejaculated mister binnie
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0003.wav,87244,if i were sure this was the same man i'd go myself
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0004.wav,155884,when i find a fellow who's neither knave nor fool i stick to him believe i'll send to find out
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0005.wav,292204,the only time he had made any comment upon her was the first time he saw her in the dress she had copied from octavia's nice gown that he blurted out didn't get it here i'll wager
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0006.wav,70124,doesn't look like it he said gruffly
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0007.wav,87244,no she answered i am not afraid at all
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0008.wav,65324,i shall not be afraid again
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0009.wav,109164,in fact she had perfectly confounded her ladyship by her demeanor
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0010.wav,129164,i beg you will not speak to me of that again she said i will not listen
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0011.wav,73324,and turning about she walked out of the room
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0012.wav,80044,and nothing more had been said on the subject since
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0013.wav,162924,before breakfast miss belinda was startled by the arrival of another telegram which ran as follows
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0014.wav,101004,arrived to day per russia be with you tomorrow evening

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0016.wav,123084,well remarked octavia i suppose that would have been an advantage
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0017.wav,186284,octavia was a marked figure upon the grounds at that garden party another dress my dear remarked missus burnham
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0018.wav,120044,and what a charming color she has i declare she is usually paler
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0019.wav,73164,perhaps we owe this to lord lansdowne
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0020.wav,105804,she's prettier than ever to day and is enjoying herself
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0021.wav,165324,she was enjoying herself mister francis barold observed it rather gloomily as he stood apart
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0022.wav,437004,and then had come lord lansdowne who in crossing the lawn to shake hands with his host had been observed to keep his eye fixed upon one particular point burmistone he said after having spoken his first words who is that tall girl in white
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0023.wav,322444,and in ten minutes lady theobald missus burnham mister barold and divers others too numerous to mention saw him standing at octavia's side evidently with no intention of leaving it
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0024.wav,258604,not long after this francis barold found his way to miss belinda who was very busy and rather nervous your niece is evidently enjoying herself he remarked
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0025.wav,103084,octavia is most happy to day answered miss belinda
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0026.wav,167404,very few people understand octavia said miss belinda i'm not sure that i follow all her moods myself
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0027.wav,115244,she is not as frivolous as she appears to those who don't know her well
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0028.wav,148204,barold stood gnawing his mustache and made no reply he was not very comfortable
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0029.wav,194444,he felt himself ill used by fate and rather wished he had returned to london from broadoaks instead of loitering in slowbridge
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0030.wav,173804,he had amused himself at first but in time he had been surprised to find his amusement lose something of its zest
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0031.wav,142284,it's deucedly bad form on his part he said mentally what does he mean by it
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0032.wav,100844,octavia on the contrary did not ask what he meant by it
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0033.wav,77484,where he ejaculated i say what a name
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0034.wav,81484,i had not observed it answered her ladyship
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0035.wav,169964,but she glared at barold as he passed and beckoned to him where is lucia she demanded
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0036.wav,293164,i saw her with burmistone half an hour ago he answered coldly have you any message for my mother i shall return to london to morrow leaving here early she turned quite pale
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0037.wav,191884,what has happened she asked rigidly he looked slightly surprised nothing whatever he replied
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0038.wav,76844,i have remained here longer than i intended
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0039.wav,81164,she began to move the manacles on her right wrist
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67804-0040.wav,105802,she had not brought lucia up under her own eye for nothing
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0000.wav,87566,chapter twenty three may i go
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0001.wav,118284,the very day after this octavia opened the fourth trunk
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0002.wav,220524,evidently something had happened octavia she said mister dugald binnie is at oldclough who is he
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0003.wav,187244,he is my grand uncle explained lucia tremulously he has a great deal of money
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0004.wav,116524,i do not quite understand grandmamma octavia she said
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0005.wav,155564,last night she came to my room to talk to me and this morning she came again and oh
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0006.wav,142444,she broke out indignantly how could she speak to me in such a manner
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0007.wav,71084,what did you understand
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0008.wav,293484,i am to run after a man who does not care for me and make myself attractive in the hope that he will condescend to marry me because mister binnie may leave me his money
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0009.wav,146924,do you wonder that it took even lady theobald a long time to say that
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0010.wav,129644,well remarked octavia you won't do it i suppose i wouldn't worry
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0011.wav,92524,oh i always knew it i didn't guess
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0012.wav,72684,and she smiled ever so faintly
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0013.wav,129804,that is one of the reasons why she loathes me so she added
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0014.wav,236844,lucia thought deeply for a moment she recognized all at once several things she had been mystified by before
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0015.wav,83564,octavia smiled a little again
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0016.wav,128684,lucia sat thinking her hands clasped tightly
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0017.wav,88364,i am glad i came here she said at length
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0018.wav,94764,i think i shall never be afraid of her any more
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6455-67803-0019.wav,235564,her delicate nostrils were dilated she held her head up her breath came fast there was a hint of exultation in her tone

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4570-14911-0006.wav,636684,it is quite possible therefore that the beagle was crossed with the welsh southern or otterhound to get more size and power as there certainly was a welsh rough coated beagle of good eighteen inches and an almost identical contemporary that was called the essex beagle
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4570-14911-0007.wav,530604,that a great many of the true order were bred became very manifest as soon as the harrier and beagle association was formed and more particularly when a section of the peterborough hound show was reserved for them

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4570-24733-0007.wav,760364,corollary hence it follows that god is not only the cause of things coming into existence but also of their continuing in existence that is in scholastic phraseology god is cause of the being of things essendi rerum

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1650-167613-0010.wav,70924,then why was it forbidden
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1650-167613-0011.wav,257964,at smolensk too he judged correctly that the french might outflank us as they had larger forces

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1650-167613-0019.wav,155724,and yet they say that war is like a game of chess he remarked
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1650-167613-0020.wav,171724,the relative strength of bodies of troops can never be known to anyone

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1650-167613-0022.wav,222604,on the feeling that is in me and in him he pointed to timokhin and in each soldier

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1650-167613-0027.wav,77804,but what awaits us tomorrow
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1650-167613-0028.wav,271404,the fact is that those men with whom you have ridden round the position not only do not help matters but hinder
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1650-167613-0029.wav,130764,that's the truth the real truth said timokhin

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1650-167613-0031.wav,114604,all were silent the officers rose
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1650-167613-0032.wav,116524,yes yes answered prince andrew absently
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1650-167613-0033.wav,376524,the french have destroyed my home and are on their way to destroy moscow they have outraged and are outraging me every moment they are my enemies
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1650-167613-0034.wav,100524,in my opinion they are all criminals
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1650-167613-0035.wav,105164,and so thinks timokhin and the whole army
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1650-167613-0036.wav,199244,since they are my foes they cannot be my friends whatever may have been said at tilsit
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1650-167613-0037.wav,167724,yes yes muttered pierre looking with shining eyes at prince andrew
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1650-167613-0038.wav,317004,they talk to us of the rules of war of chivalry of flags of truce of mercy to the unfortunate and so on it's all rubbish
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1650-167613-0039.wav,403884,they plunder other people's houses issue false paper money and worst of all they kill my children and my father and then talk of rules of war and magnanimity to foes
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1650-167613-0040.wav,119724,take no prisoners but kill and be killed
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1650-167613-0041.wav,434764,prince andrew who had thought it was all the same to him whether or not moscow was taken as smolensk had been was suddenly checked in his speech by an unexpected cramp in his throat
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1650-167613-0042.wav,300044,he paced up and down a few times in silence but his eyes glittered feverishly and his lips quivered as he began speaking
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1650-167613-0043.wav,136204,and when there was a war like this one it would be war
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1650-167613-0044.wav,100364,what is needed for success in warfare
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1650-167613-0045.wav,196844,and in spite of all this it is the highest class respected by everyone
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1650-167613-0046.wav,98924,how does god above look at them and hear them
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1650-167613-0047.wav,119404,i see that i have begun to understand too much
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1650-167613-0048.wav,297964,and it doesn't do for man to taste of the tree of knowledge of good and evil ah well it's not for long he added
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1650-167613-0049.wav,140684,however you're sleepy and it's time for me to sleep
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1650-167613-0050.wav,113324,go back to gorki said prince andrew suddenly
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1650-167613-0051.wav,179404,go go before a battle one must have one's sleep out repeated prince andrew
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1650-167613-0052.wav,109164,no he does not want it pierre concluded
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1650-167613-0053.wav,102604,and i know that this is our last meeting
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1650-167613-0054.wav,113484,one picture succeeded another in his imagination
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1650-167613-0055.wav,106764,on one of them he dwelt long and joyfully
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0000.wav,202444,his characters get drunk or go mad with jealousy or fall in epileptic fits or rave hysterically
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0001.wav,126604,if dostoevsky had had less vision he would have been strindberg
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0002.wav,96684,like them he is a novelist of torture
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0003.wav,297484,certainly the lust of cruelty the lust of destruction for destruction's sake is the most conspicuous of the deadly sins in dostoevsky's men and women
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0004.wav,83404,he may not be a cruel author
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0005.wav,139564,but they are never in balance they are always in demoniacal conflict
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0006.wav,166924,even the lust is never or hardly ever the lust of a more or less sane man
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0007.wav,153004,dostoevsky could not have described the sin of nekhludov in resurrection
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0008.wav,106124,this is a madhouse cries some one in the idiot
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0009.wav,109484,one result of this is a multiplicity of action
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0010.wav,106604,even the talk is of actions more than of ideas
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0011.wav,133484,he sows violent deeds not with the hand but with the sack
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0012.wav,284364,but one had noticed during those last two days that the other was wearing a silver watch on a yellow bead chain which he seems not to have seen on him before
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0013.wav,366764,he took a knife and when his friend had turned away he approached him cautiously from behind took aim turned his eyes heavenwards crossed himself and praying fervently god forgive me for christ's sake
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0014.wav,191244,he never paints everyman he always projects dostoevsky or a nightmare of dostoevsky
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0015.wav,225164,that is why crime and punishment belongs to a lower range of fiction than anna karenina or fathers and sons
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0016.wav,168364,we sympathize indeed with the fears the bravado the despair that succeed the crime
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0017.wav,162924,he is a grotesque made alive by sheer imaginative intensity and passion
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0018.wav,122764,one does not grudge an artist an abnormal character or two
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0019.wav,157484,he invents vicious grotesques as dickens invents comic grotesques
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0020.wav,140844,was very fond of hanging cats and burying them with great ceremony
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0021.wav,281004,as for the karamazovs themselves he portrays the old father and the eldest of his sons hating each other and fighting like brutal maniacs
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0022.wav,92204,serve him right shouted dmitri breathlessly
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0023.wav,94764,if i haven't killed him i'll come again and kill him
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0024.wav,130604,it is easy to see why dostoevsky has become a popular author
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0025.wav,163884,no melodramatist ever poured out incident upon the stage from such a horn of plenty
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0026.wav,113004,dostoevsky is always ready to show them all in at once
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0027.wav,930764,on two opposite pages of the idiot one finds the following characters brought in by name general epanchin prince s adelaida ivanovna lizaveta prokofyevna yevgeny pavlovitch radomsky princess byelokonsky aglaia prince myshkin kolya ivolgin ippolit varya ferdyshchenko nastasya filippovna nina alexandrovna ganya ptitsyn and general ivolgin
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0028.wav,213164,but the secret of dostoevsky's appeal is something more than the multitude and thrill of his incidents and characters
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0029.wav,134764,mister murry boldly faces the difficulty and attempts the definition
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0030.wav,328684,to him dostoevsky's work is the record of a great mind seeking for a way of life it is more than a record of struggle it is the struggle itself
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0031.wav,384684,and those voices take shape in certain unforgettable fragments of dialogue that have been spoken by one spirit to another in some ugly mean tavern set in surrounding darkness
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0032.wav,223724,ultimately they are the creations not of a man who desired to be but of a spirit which sought to know
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0033.wav,123404,because they are possessed they are no longer men and women
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0034.wav,75084,this is all in a measure true
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0035.wav,317804,to say this is not to deny the spiritual content of dostoevsky's work the anguish of the imprisoned soul as it battles with doubt and denial and despair
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0036.wav,238444,there is in dostoevsky a suggestion of caliban trying to discover some better god than setebos
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0037.wav,244364,the ultimate attitude of dostoevsky is as christian as the apostle peter's lord i believe help thou mine unbelief
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0038.wav,242924,and beyond the dark night of suffering and dissipating the night dostoevsky still sees the light of christian compassion
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0039.wav,146764,or even by the compassion of others like prince myshkin in the idiot
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0040.wav,157324,his work like his face bears the mark of this terrible conflict
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0041.wav,95884,the novels are the perfect image of the man
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6123-59150-0042.wav,221164,as to the man himself the vicomte de voguee described him as he saw him in the last years of his life

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-53049-0019.wav,888684,penelope was surprised as much as the tender sisterly heart could wish when doris flashed out upon her triumphantly on the evening of the party with the black skirt nicely pressed and re hung and the prettiest waist imaginable a waist that was a positive creation of dainty rose besprinkled silk with a girdle and knots of black velvet
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-53049-0020.wav,245164,so penelope went to blanche's party and her dress was the admiration of every girl there

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-53049-0028.wav,186764,soon after this our mother died and our household was broken up

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0005.wav,290764,all her days were alike as far as hard work and dullness went but she accepted them cheerfully and uncomplainingly
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0006.wav,191724,but she did resent having to look after the baby when she wanted to write her letter
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0007.wav,191084,the room was small a mere box above the kitchen which sidney shared with two small cousins

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0012.wav,158764,presently she began to write with a flush of real excitement on her face

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0015.wav,254124,he never had done so but ellen douglas's letter was so interesting that he had decided to write to her
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0016.wav,89964,would she be kind enough to correspond with him
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0017.wav,206924,he was two years out from the east and had not yet forgotten to be homesick at times
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0018.wav,99564,sidney liked the letter and answered it
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0019.wav,168044,she never expected to meet john lincoln nor did she wish to do so
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0020.wav,117804,in the correspondence itself she found her pleasure
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0021.wav,763084,john lincoln wrote breezy accounts of ranch life and adventures on the far western plains so alien and remote from snug humdrum plainfield life that sidney always had the sensation of crossing a gulf when she opened a letter from the bar n as for sidney's own letter this is the way it read as she wrote it
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0022.wav,158284,the evergreens plainfield dear mister lincoln

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0024.wav,159244,the man i had been talking with was paul moore the great novelist
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0025.wav,431244,as it was i had contradicted him twice and he had laughed and liked it but his books will always have a new meaning to me henceforth through the insight he himself has given me
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0026.wav,153644,it is such meetings as these that give life its sparkle for me
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0027.wav,129644,you will be weary of my rhapsodies over her
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0028.wav,145164,she has sympathy and understanding for my every mood
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0029.wav,97484,yours sincerely sidney richmond
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0030.wav,511244,aunt jane came home presently and carried away her sleeping baby sidney said her prayers went to bed and slept soundly and serenely she mailed her letter the next day and a month later an answer came
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0031.wav,223884,sidney did not sleep that night but tossed restlessly about or cried in her pillow
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0032.wav,87404,the good woman shook her head
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0033.wav,251244,sidney trod the way of the transgressor and found that its thorns pierced to bone and marrow
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0034.wav,72364,you see that road out thar
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0035.wav,148204,and there was no harbour or glimpse of distant sea visible
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0036.wav,92364,had the hotel keeper made a mistake
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0037.wav,177484,this is his place nobody calls it the evergreens but myself
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0038.wav,110924,i don't understand he said perplexedly
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0039.wav,179404,oh sidney threw out her hands in a burst of passionate protest
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0040.wav,154444,no and you never will understand i can't make you understand
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0041.wav,143884,everything i told you about it and my life was just imagination
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0042.wav,108204,then why did you write them he asked blankly
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0043.wav,68044,why did you deceive me
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0044.wav,149964,oh i didn't mean to deceive you i never thought of such a thing
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0045.wav,242924,i just couldn't write you about my life here not because it was hard but it was so ugly and empty
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0046.wav,107244,and when once i had begun i had to keep it up
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0047.wav,91244,i found it so fascinating too
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0048.wav,198764,those letters made that other life seem real to me i never expected to meet you
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0049.wav,154444,these last four days since your letter came have been dreadful to me
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0050.wav,123404,oh please go away and forgive me if you can
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0051.wav,113004,it was worse than she had even thought it would be
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0052.wav,132524,he was so handsome so manly so earnest eyed
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0053.wav,117484,john lincoln opened the gate and went up to her
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0054.wav,243564,please don't distress yourself so sidney he said unconsciously using her christian name
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0055.wav,62444,i think i do understand
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0056.wav,113164,i'm not such a dull fellow as you take me for
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0057.wav,192684,after all those letters were true or rather there was truth in them
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0058.wav,115884,this young man was certainly good at understanding
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/6267-65525-0059.wav,134764,you you'll forgive me then she stammered
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245715-0000.wav,137644,but in the state of innocence there would have been no weakness of old age
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245715-0001.wav,290604,on the contrary everything generated is first imperfect but in the state of innocence children would have been begotten by generation
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245715-0002.wav,175724,therefore from the first they would have been imperfect in bodily size and power
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245715-0003.wav,383884,therefore in the state of innocence there was no need for women to be born on the contrary nature's process in generation would have been in harmony with the manner in which it was established by god
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245712-0000.wav,133804,four whether in that state man would have been master over men
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245712-0001.wav,143404,therefore in the state of innocence man had no mastership of the animals
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245712-0002.wav,207244,therefore in the state of innocence before man had disobeyed nothing disobeyed him that was naturally subject to him
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245712-0003.wav,193324,secondly this is proved by the order of divine providence which always governs inferior things by the superior
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245712-0004.wav,129804,thirdly this is proved from a property of man and of other animals
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245712-0005.wav,156524,now whatever is participated is subject to what is essential and universal
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245712-0006.wav,135404,therefore the subjection of other animals to man is proved to be natural
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245712-0007.wav,351564,they would not however on this account have been excepted from the mastership of man as neither at present are they for that reason excepted from the mastership of god whose providence has ordained all this
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245712-0008.wav,223884,this is signified by the fact that god led the animals to man that he might give them names expressive of their respective natures
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245712-0009.wav,203724,so all animals would have obeyed man of their own accord as in the present state some domestic animals obey him
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245712-0010.wav,233964,objection one it would seem that in the state of innocence man would not have had mastership over all other creatures
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245712-0011.wav,130124,much less therefore would it have obeyed man in the state of innocence
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245712-0012.wav,252364,therefore since it is by his reason that man is competent to have mastership it seems that in the state of innocence man had no dominion over plants
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245712-0013.wav,125964,now in man reason has the position of a master and not of a subject
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245712-0014.wav,569164,i answer that we must needs admit that in the primitive state there would have been some inequality at least as regards sex because generation depends upon diversity of sex and likewise as regards age for some would have been born of others nor would sexual union have been sterile
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245712-0015.wav,93004,there might also have been bodily disparity
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245712-0016.wav,190444,inequality might also arise on the part of nature as above described without any defect of nature
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245712-0017.wav,192364,objection one it would seem that in the state of innocence man would not have been master over man
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245712-0018.wav,136364,therefore in the state of innocence man would not have been subject to man
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245712-0019.wav,320684,in another sense mastership is referred in a general sense to any kind of subject and in this sense even he who has the office of governing and directing free men can be called a master
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-245712-0020.wav,182764,such a kind of mastership would have existed in the state of innocence between man and man for two reasons
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105817-0000.wav,166924,more than this he hath been heard to rail on you my lord who are now his judge
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105817-0001.wav,231084,judge thy just doom would be to die on the spot still let us hear what thou hast to say
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105817-0002.wav,238284,then the judge to sum up the case spoke thus you see this man who has made such a stir in our town
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105817-0003.wav,210284,thus while one lost his life for the truth a new man rose from his death to tread the same way with christian
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105817-0004.wav,142924,come good hopeful said christian let us walk on the grass
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105817-0005.wav,65164,so they set off through the field
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105817-0006.wav,329964,hopeful i had my fears from the first and so gave you a hint christian good friend i grieve that i have brought you out of the right path
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105817-0007.wav,132524,hopeful say no more no doubt it is for our good
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105817-0008.wav,140204,christian we must not stand thus let us try to go back
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105817-0009.wav,315724,then said giant despair you have no right to force your way in here the ground on which you lie is mine
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105817-0010.wav,120524,they had not much to say as they knew that they were in fault
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105817-0011.wav,88044,and by this act we kill our souls as well
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105815-0000.wav,208524,he now went on till he came to the house at the door of which he was to knock this he did two or three times
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105815-0001.wav,126924,christian i have come to see the good man of the house
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105815-0002.wav,246124,christian sir i am come from the city of destruction and am on my way to mount zion
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105815-0003.wav,199884,i was told by the man that stands at the gate that if i came here you would show me good things that would help me
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105815-0004.wav,167564,he stood as if he would plead for men and a crown of gold hung near his head
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105815-0005.wav,93484,christian what does this mean
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105815-0006.wav,267244,then he took him to a large room that was full of dust for it had not been swept and interpreter told his man to sweep it
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105815-0007.wav,89004,christian what means this
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105815-0008.wav,219884,then you next saw the maid come in to lay the dust so is sin made clean and laid low by faith in the book
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105815-0009.wav,289964,just as christian came up to the cross his load slid from his back close to the mouth of the tomb where it fell in and i saw it no more
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105815-0010.wav,303564,as he stood thus and wept lo three bright ones came to him and one of them said peace be to thee thou hast grace from thy sins
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105815-0011.wav,263564,christian gave three leaps for joy and sang as he went ah what a place is this blest cross blest tomb
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105815-0012.wav,244204,he went on thus till he came to a vale where he saw three men who were in a sound sleep with chains on their feet
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105815-0013.wav,140524,christian sirs whence come you and where do you go
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105815-0014.wav,274444,formalist and hypocrisy we were born in the land of vain glory and are on our way to mount zion for praise
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105815-0015.wav,205964,know you not that he that comes not in at the door but climbs up to get in the same is a thief
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105815-0016.wav,278444,they told christian that he had no need for care on that score for long use had made it law and they could prove that it had been so for years
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105815-0017.wav,86924,yes said they no doubt of it
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105815-0018.wav,135244,and if we get in the road at all pray what are the odds
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105815-0019.wav,79404,is not our case as good as yours
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105815-0020.wav,210604,i saw then that they all went on till they came to the foot of the hill of difficulty where there was a spring
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105815-0021.wav,195564,now when christian got as far as the spring of life he drank of it and then went up the hill
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105815-0022.wav,186124,now half way up was a cave made by the lord of that hill that those who came by might rest there
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105815-0023.wav,401964,timorous said that zion was the hill they meant to climb but that when they had got half way they found that they met with more and more risk so that great fear came on them and all they could do was to turn back
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105815-0024.wav,397004,yes said mistrust for just in front of us there lay two beasts of prey in our path we knew not if they slept or not but we thought that they would fall on us and tear our limbs
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105815-0025.wav,289484,yet he thought once more of what he had heard from the men and then he felt in his cloak for his scroll that he might read it and find some peace
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105815-0026.wav,74604,he felt for it but found it not
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105815-0027.wav,252204,so he fell down on his knees to pray that god would give him grace for this act and then went back to look for his scroll
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/7697-105815-0028.wav,388044,oh fool that i am said he to sleep in the day time so to give way to the flesh as to use for ease that rest which the lord of the hill had made but for the help of the soul

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1585-131718-0003.wav,483564,when the result is achieved the invention makes its appeal on the score of economy of material or of effort and then labor often awaits with crushing and tyrannical spirit to smash the apparatus or forbid its very use
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1585-131718-0004.wav,243404,possibly our national optimism as revealed in invention the seeking a higher good needs some check

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1585-131718-0007.wav,193644,yet the very vogue of the electric arc light made harder the arrival of the incandescent
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1585-131718-0008.wav,510604,a number of parent arc lighting companies were in existence and a great many local companies had been called into being under franchises for commercial business and to execute regular city contracts for street lighting
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1585-131718-0009.wav,580044,thus in a curious manner the modern art of electric lighting was in a very true sense divided against itself with intense rivalries and jealousies which were none the less real because they were but temporary and occurred in a field where ultimate union of forces was inevitable
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1585-131718-0010.wav,328364,hence twenty years after the first edison stations were established the methods they involved could be fairly credited with no less than sixty seven per cent
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1585-131718-0011.wav,618764,it will be readily understood that under these conditions the modern lighting company supplies to its customers both incandescent and arc lighting frequently from the same dynamo electric machinery as a source of current and that the old feud as between the rival systems has died out
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/1585-131718-0012.wav,434764,in fact for some years past the presidents of the national electric light association have been chosen almost exclusively from among the managers of the great edison lighting companies in the leading cities

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/8254-115543-0021.wav,364524,it turned out that it was a great and powerful rajah going in state on a journey to visit another rajah or ruler of one of the small kingdoms or states of which modern india was formerly made up

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/8254-84205-0033.wav,98924,but the enemy won't be standing still continued griggs

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/8254-84205-0035.wav,110284,but our animals will be well back in that hollow said chris

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/8254-84205-0038.wav,250764,yes that's right if it can be done but it would go hard with us all if the indians gave up the bait of the trap and turned upon those who set it
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/8254-84205-0039.wav,90604,well you must talk it over with father said chris

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/8254-84205-0045.wav,399084,just then the doctor came into the shelter where the boys had been talking bringing with him wilton who had been shooting or rather trying to shoot for he had had no success and they too were talking earnestly about ways and means
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/8254-84205-0046.wav,80204,oh here you are griggs cried the doctor

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/8254-84205-0048.wav,200044,the indians have shifted their quarters and they're in about as awkward a position as they could contrive for our purpose
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/8254-84205-0049.wav,87724,we must get away from here to some good hunting ground
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/8254-84205-0050.wav,96684,do the indians seem to be camping or only on the move
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/8254-84205-0051.wav,120204,they seem to me to be hatching up some dodge or another replied griggs
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/8254-84205-0052.wav,143724,then he began to walk up and down slowly evidently deep in thought
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/8254-84205-0053.wav,100044,there he said i've made up my mind
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/8254-84205-0054.wav,221644,it is very evident that we may wait here till our stores are exhausted and be as far off the opportunity we seek as ever
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/8254-84205-0055.wav,130444,the indians can wait we cannot and they seem to know it
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/8254-84205-0056.wav,118284,going to give up young chris's plan said griggs slowly

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/8254-84205-0058.wav,89644,but all the same we can be making our preparations
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/8254-84205-0059.wav,99404,the barrels can be filled with water and every one's bottle
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/8254-84205-0060.wav,155404,provisions can be packed in our wallets in fact everything held ready for a start
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/8254-84205-0061.wav,137164,finally just at dusk the animals can be driven in for food and water and
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/8254-84205-0062.wav,71244,exactly replied the doctor
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/8254-84205-0063.wav,148364,but before any more is said griggs i want to offer you the opportunity to draw back
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/8254-84205-0064.wav,84204,what for said griggs sharply
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/8254-84205-0065.wav,109326,not a bit of it sir i'm going to take care they don't hit me
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/8254-84205-0066.wav,236524,i mean to do a bit to carry out young chris's plan and shut up the redskins for a week or two perhaps a month while we get right away
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/8254-84205-0067.wav,81164,there is a horrible side to it griggs
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/8254-84205-0068.wav,94124,would be if we let them get the better of us sir
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/8254-84205-0069.wav,87724,you mean the shutting up the enemy here to starve
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/8254-84205-0070.wav,156204,ejaculated griggs so sharply that the boys started serve em right if they did sir
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/8254-84205-0071.wav,124204,what business have they to want our scalps but we shouldn't shut them up to starve
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/8254-84205-0072.wav,169484,they'd have weeks of work before they could get their horses out but without horses they'd be out in a week
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/8254-84205-0073.wav,61164,starve nonsense
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/8254-84205-0074.wav,121324,but there i don't want to make speeches it's all settled gentlemen
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/8254-84205-0075.wav,89324,but you've got to tell the lookout what's coming off
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/8254-84205-0076.wav,208364,now every one understands that he is to be ready without showing any watchful indian scout that there is something on the way
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0000.wav,457004,yet so strong was the effect upon him of contemplating a large fortune that in despite of reason and desire he lived in eager expectation of the word which should make him rich
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0001.wav,174124,a part of that impression was due to the engagement which he must now fulfil
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0002.wav,205484,to shuffle out of this duty would make him too ignoble even in his own eyes
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0003.wav,467404,because in his salad days he dallied with a girl who had indeed many charms step by step he had come to the necessity of sacrificing his prospects to that raw attachment
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0004.wav,178444,unable to think of work he left the house and wandered gloomily about regent's park
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0005.wav,260684,he felt himself ill used by destiny and therefore by marian who was fate's instrument
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0006.wav,63404,he wrote to marian
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0007.wav,109484,will you let me hear or come and see me
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0008.wav,115084,i scarcely thought of biffen as likely to kill himself
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0009.wav,127884,but why the deuce did he go all the way out there
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0010.wav,87404,i hoped you would bring me some news
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0011.wav,87084,poverty i can only suppose
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0012.wav,175724,but i will see whelpdale i hadn't come across biffen for a long time
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0013.wav,93644,was he still so very poor
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0014.wav,82764,asked amy compassionately
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0015.wav,127404,i'm afraid so his book failed utterly
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0016.wav,229324,oh if i had imagined him still in such distress surely i might have done something to help him
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0017.wav,147244,perchance his death was in part attributable to that hopeless love
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0018.wav,187884,he sent me a copy of his novel she said and i saw him once or twice after that
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0019.wav,221644,having this subject to converse upon put the two more quickly at ease than could otherwise have been the case
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0020.wav,128204,amy might take a foremost place among brilliant women
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0021.wav,125644,especially now that her father is threatened with blindness
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0022.wav,68684,is it so serious
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0023.wav,236844,even if mister yule recovers his sight it is not at all likely that he will be able to work as before
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0024.wav,105004,our difficulties are so grave that
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0025.wav,149964,he paused and let his hand fail despondently
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0026.wav,237484,i have a good deal of will you remember and what i have set my mind upon no doubt i shall some day achieve
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0027.wav,66924,there was silence
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0028.wav,181644,the last three years he continued have made no slight difference in my position
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0029.wav,101004,recall where i stood when you first knew me
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0030.wav,110444,just now i am in need of a little encouragement
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0031.wav,120364,you don't notice any falling off in my work recently
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0032.wav,163724,do you see my things in the current and so on generally
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0033.wav,135724,sometimes i believe i have detected you when there was no signature
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0034.wav,111564,her story in that girls paper has attracted attention
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0035.wav,193804,and i could so easily put her at rest by renouncing all claim upon her
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0036.wav,222764,i surmise that that you yourself would also be put at rest by such a decision
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0037.wav,141804,don't look at me with that ironical smile he pleaded
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0038.wav,457484,i couldn't go about declaring that i was heartbroken in any event i must be content for people to judge me according to their disposition and judgments are pretty sure to be unfavourable what can i do
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0039.wav,150764,the case is too delicate i fear for my advice
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0040.wav,90604,well i'll go back to my scribbling
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0041.wav,194604,again jasper held the white soft hand for a superfluous moment
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0042.wav,198764,yet for such feelings he reproached himself and the reproach made him angry
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0043.wav,184364,marian could not mistake the air of restless trouble on her companion's smooth countenance
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0044.wav,327564,she had divined that there was some grave reason for this summons and the panting with which she had approached was half caused by the anxious beats of her heart
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0045.wav,64044,he began abruptly
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0046.wav,161964,he gave her such details as he had obtained then added
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0047.wav,114924,there are two of my companions fallen in the battle
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0048.wav,151084,i ought to think myself a lucky fellow marian what
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0049.wav,116524,you are better fitted to fight your way jasper
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0050.wav,75084,more of a brute you mean
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0051.wav,78284,you know very well i don't
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0052.wav,151884,i have made up my mind about our affairs he went on presently
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0053.wav,42764,yes
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0054.wav,102284,will you marry me and let us take our chance
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0055.wav,131884,you feel yourself indispensable to your father at present
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0056.wav,147404,i should be so afraid of the effect upon his health jasper
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0057.wav,129644,she paused and looked up at him touchingly
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0058.wav,218924,dear i can't feel it would be my duty to renounce you because my father had become blind
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0059.wav,73164,has one thing occurred to you
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0060.wav,194764,will he consent to receive an allowance from a person whose name is missus milvain
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0061.wav,187564,and if he obstinately refuses what then what is before him
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0062.wav,105164,she listened anxiously and reflected
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0063.wav,233004,as i have said there is the very serious doubt whether your father would accept money from you when you are my wife
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0064.wav,199084,it isn't your fault marian and well then there's only one thing to do
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0065.wav,222604,except jasper that if father is helpless i must find means of assuring his support
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0066.wav,72044,do you think them insurmountable
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0067.wav,197804,that is just what i have decided is impossible marian you shall have the plain truth
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0068.wav,101324,i don't trust myself
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0069.wav,97964,but shall you face them willingly
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0070.wav,76044,put up your umbrella marian
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0071.wav,317964,what do i care for a drop of rain she exclaimed with passionate sadness when all my life is at stake how am i to understand you
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0072.wav,132364,every word you speak seems intended to dishearten me
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0073.wav,116204,why need you conceal it if that is the truth
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0074.wav,117644,is that what you mean by saying you distrust yourself
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0075.wav,84684,we must see each other again marian
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0076.wav,127244,how am i to live an hour in such uncertainty as this
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0077.wav,61804,i do wish it
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0078.wav,120684,her emotion had an effect upon him and his voice trembled
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0079.wav,172204,there is no natural law that a child should surrender everything for her parents
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0080.wav,173964,you know so much more of the world than i do can't you advise me
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0081.wav,116364,is there no way of providing for my father
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0082.wav,179564,good god this is frightful marian i can't stand it
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0083.wav,83244,i will be faithful to you
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0084.wav,407724,he had made a pretence of holding his umbrella over her but marian turned away and walked to a little distance and stood beneath the shelter of a great tree her face averted from him
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0085.wav,180684,moving to follow he saw that her frame was shaken by soundless sobbing
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0086.wav,102924,in what can there be more selfishness
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0087.wav,182124,but i couldn't say a word that would seem to invite such misery as this
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0088.wav,172204,you don't love me jasper and that's an end of everything
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0089.wav,109644,happiness or misery come to us by fate
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0090.wav,91564,is it in my power to make you happy
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0091.wav,205804,but if you had said you loved me before that i should have it always to remember
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0092.wav,130444,if i believe anything i believe that i did love you
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0093.wav,130764,what can you say to me more than you have said now
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0094.wav,414284,remember me as a man who disregarded priceless love such as yours to go and make himself a proud position among fools and knaves indeed that's what it comes to
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0095.wav,267884,soon enough you would thoroughly despise me and though i should know it was merited my perverse pride would revolt against it
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0096.wav,67244,what can be simpler than the truth
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0097.wav,277004,it is a thing that happens every day either in man or woman and all that honour demands is the courage to confess the truth
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0098.wav,293004,marian will you do this will you let our engagement last for another six months but without our meeting during that time
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0099.wav,71084,that seems to me childish
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0100.wav,200684,the rain fell unceasingly and with it began to mingle an autumnal mist
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0101.wav,122604,jasper delayed a moment then asked calmly
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0102.wav,122924,are you going to the museum yes
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0103.wav,147884,go home again for this morning marian you can't work
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0104.wav,118444,i must and i have no time to lose
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0105.wav,97324,good bye she gave him her hand
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0106.wav,270924,they looked at each other for an instant then marian left the shelter of the tree opened her umbrella and walked quickly away
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0107.wav,247244,jasper did not watch her he had the face of a man who is suffering a severe humiliation
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0108.wav,211244,his sister said very little for she recognised genuine suffering in his tones and aspect
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0109.wav,440204,a few weeks ago he actually proposed to a woman for whom he does not pretend to have the slightest affection but who is very rich and who seemed likely to be foolish enough to marry him
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0110.wav,169164,yesterday morning he received her final answer a refusal
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0111.wav,243246,you will understand though surely you need no fresh proof how utterly unworthy he is of you
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0112.wav,177164,you are the only friend i have of my own sex and i could not bear to lose you
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0113.wav,109004,several days passed before there came a reply
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4515-11057-0114.wav,372044,i must only ask that you will write to me without the least reference to these troubles tell me always about yourself and be sure that you cannot tell me too much
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/3915-57461-0000.wav,264844,we have succeeded in amassing two hundred ounces of silver enough i trust to erect a handsome bronze figure
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/3915-57461-0001.wav,458764,to be sure it seems a shame yet if i could steal the money this priest is boasting about i could live at ease for the rest of my days and so he began casting about how best he might compass his purpose
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/3915-57461-0002.wav,248044,but the priest far from guessing the drift of his comrade's thoughts journeyed cheerfully on till they reached the town of kuana
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/3915-57461-0003.wav,327724,here there is an arm of the sea which is crossed in ferry boats that start as soon as some twenty or thirty passengers are gathered together and in one of these boats the two travellers embarked
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/3915-57461-0004.wav,560844,when the boatmen and passengers heard the splash and saw the priest struggling in the water they were afraid and made every effort to save him but the wind was fair and the boat running swiftly under the bellying sails so they were soon a few hundred yards off from the drowning man who sank before the boat could be turned to rescue him
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/3915-57461-0005.wav,505164,when he saw this the ronin feigned the utmost grief and dismay and said to his fellow passengers this priest whom we have just lost was my cousin he was going to kiyoto to visit the shrine of his patron and as i happened to have business there as well we settled to travel together
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/3915-57461-0006.wav,194124,now alas by this misfortune my cousin is dead and i am left alone
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/3915-57461-0007.wav,287084,he spoke so feelingly and wept so freely that the passengers believed his story and pitied and tried to comfort him
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/3915-57461-0008.wav,70124,then the ronin said to the boatmen

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-13259-0001.wav,345164,and all through his impassioned appeal this morning there was a note of sadness and rebuke and stern condemnation that made many of the members pale with self accusation or with inward anger

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-13259-0011.wav,305324,since the first sunday when the first company of volunteers had pledged themselves to do as jesus would do the different meetings had been characterized by distinct impulses or impressions
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-13259-0012.wav,184844,and all through it ran one general cry for deliverance from the saloon and its awful curse
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-13259-0013.wav,247084,gray and his wife were besieged by inquirers who wanted to know what loreen's friends and acquaintances were expected to do in paying their last respects to her

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-13259-0019.wav,246284,it happened that that afternoon a somewhat noted newspaper correspondent was passing through raymond on his way to an editorial convention in a neighboring city
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-13259-0020.wav,290124,she was a common street drunkard and yet the services at the tent were as impressive as any i ever witnessed in a metropolitan church over the most distinguished citizen
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-13259-0021.wav,334286,it struck me of course being a stranger in the place with considerable astonishment to hear voices like those one naturally expects to hear only in great churches or concerts at such a meeting as this
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-13259-0022.wav,332684,mister maxwell spoke of the fact that the dead woman had been fully prepared to go but he spoke in a peculiarly sensitive manner of the effect of the liquor business on the lives of men and women like this one
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-13259-0023.wav,185644,raymond of course being a railroad town and the centre of the great packing interests for this region is full of saloons
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-13259-0024.wav,120524,then followed what was perhaps the queer part of this strange service
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-13259-0025.wav,164044,it was one of the simplest and at the same time one of the most impressive sights i ever witnessed
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-13259-0026.wav,182284,there must have been a hundred of these women and i was told many of them had been converted at the meetings just recently
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0000.wav,188364,the next moment he fell back in amazement before the impetuous rush of a starry eyed flushed cheeked young woman who demanded

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0003.wav,203244,it was one matter for her to object to this thing billy was doing but quite another for pete to do it of course it's she
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0004.wav,212364,retorted aunt hannah testily as if you yourself didn't bring her here with your crazy messages at this time of night pete where is he

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0006.wav,117804,pete had recovered himself by now but he did not even glance toward aunt hannah
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0007.wav,192204,miss billy miss billy you're an angel straight from heaven you are you are oh i'm so glad you came

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0009.wav,242124,billy turned eagerly but before she could take so much as one step toward the door at the end of the hall aunt hannah's indignant voice arrested her billy stop
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0010.wav,200364,pete go tell your master that we are here and ask if he will receive us pete's lips twitched
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0011.wav,91564,but his face was preternaturally grave when he spoke
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0012.wav,184364,a flying figure brushed by him and fell on its knees by the couch with a low cry bertram's eyes flew open
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0013.wav,197964,dong ling found him there a minute later polishing a silver teaspoon with a fringed napkin that had been spread over bertram's tray
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0014.wav,245804,in the hall above aunt hannah was crying into william's gray linen duster that hung on the hall rack aunt hannah's handkerchief was on the floor back at hillside
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0015.wav,200524,then very gradually it dawned over them that there was after all something strange and unexplained in it all
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0016.wav,225164,as if to make sure that she was here like this he drew her even closer bertram was so thankful that he did have one arm that was usable
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0017.wav,275884,why of of course stammered billy i couldn't help thinking that maybe you had found out you didn't want me
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0018.wav,68044,demanded bertram angry and mystified
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0019.wav,111404,as for my not painting again you didn't understand pete dearie
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0020.wav,91884,she pulled herself half away from bertram's encircling arm
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0021.wav,69164,billy drew a quivering sigh
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0022.wav,142924,good heavens is kate in this too bertram's voice was savage now

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0024.wav,135404,billy laughed gayly but she shifted her position and did not meet her lover's eyes
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0025.wav,117804,and you never did think for a minute billy that you cared for him
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0026.wav,99084,he had not been slow to mark that swift lowering of her eyelids
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0027.wav,134764,billy was so glad bertram had turned the question on her love instead of arkwright's
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0028.wav,97164,after a minute billy stirred and sighed happily
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0029.wav,123404,you see i wasn't in love with mister arkwright

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0031.wav,66764,billy put a soft finger on his lips
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/dev-other-wav/4323-55228-0032.wav,132844,bertram kissed the finger and subsided humph he commented
