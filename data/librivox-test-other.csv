/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0000.wav,67084,i am from the cutter lying off the coast
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0001.wav,80364,don't cry he said i was obliged to come
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0002.wav,160684,and and you have not found out anything came in quick frightened tones
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0003.wav,122604,i wish you would believe me that i am in as great trouble about it as you are
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0004.wav,115404,that my father sir risdon graeme has smuggled goods here
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0005.wav,109644,he could not help it he hates the smugglers you shall not tell
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0006.wav,119084,pray pray say you will not archy was silent
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0007.wav,246124,then as archy stood in the dark literally aghast with astonishment he heard the faint rustling once more and again all was silent
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0008.wav,471404,he laughed but it was a curious kind of laugh full of vexation injured amour propre as the french call our love of our own dignity of which archibald raystoke in the full flush of his young belief in his importance as a british officer had a pretty good stock
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0009.wav,127724,it all comes of dressing up in this stupid way like a rough fisher lad
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0010.wav,217964,cold water came on this idea directly as he recalled the fact that the darkness was intense and celia could not have seen him
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0011.wav,93804,i'll soon show them that i am not going to be played with
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0012.wav,228684,for it suddenly occurred to him that he was not only a prisoner but a prisoner in the power of a very reckless set of people who would stop at nothing
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0013.wav,172204,no he thought to himself i don't believe they would kill me but they would knock me about
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0014.wav,310764,the kick he had received was a foretaste of what he might expect and after a little consideration he came to the conclusion that his duty was to escape and get back to the cutter as quickly as he could
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0015.wav,307564,to do this he must scheme lie hid till morning then make for the nearest point and signal for help unless a boat's crew were already searching for him how to escape
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0016.wav,193484,the window was barred but he went to it and tried the bars one by one to find them all solidly fitted into the stone sill
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0017.wav,213644,next moment as he felt his way about his hand touched an old fashioned marble mantelpiece fireplace chimney
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0018.wav,99564,yes if other ways failed he could escape up the chimney
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0019.wav,75724,no that was too bad he could not do that
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0020.wav,281004,sympathy and pity for the dwellers in the hoze were completely gone now and he set his teeth fast and mentally called himself a weak idiot for ever thinking about such people
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0021.wav,94764,a narrow table against the wall in two places
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0022.wav,187884,he went and tried to force his head through recalling as he did that where a person's head would go the rest of the body would pass
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0023.wav,107724,but there was no chance for his body there the head would not go first
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96591-0024.wav,164684,a fellow who was shut up in prison for life might do it he said but not in a case like this
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96592-0000.wav,134764,sure you've looked round everywhere boy yes father quite

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96592-0003.wav,389484,stop here till sir risdon comes down and tell him i'm very sorry that we should have cleared out last night only a born fool saw jerry nandy's lobster boat coming into the cove and came running to say it was a party from the cutter yes father
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96592-0004.wav,138444,tell him not to be uneasy tis all right and i'll have everything clear away to night
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96592-0005.wav,275404,the dull sound of departing steps and a low whistling sound coming down through the skylight window into the cabin where archy raystoke lay with his heavy eyelids pressed down by sleep
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96592-0006.wav,77324,what a queer dream he thought to himself
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96592-0007.wav,164524,but how queer for mister gurr to be talking like that to andrew teal the boy who helped the cook
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96592-0008.wav,86444,and why did andy call mister gurr father
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96592-0009.wav,157164,there was an interval of thinking over this knotty question during which the low whistling went on
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96592-0010.wav,101324,and i'm hungry too time i was up i suppose
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96592-0011.wav,217484,no he was not dreaming for he was looking out on the sea over which a faint mist hung like wreaths of smoke
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96592-0012.wav,319244,what did they say false alarm tell sir risdon they would clear all away to night see if anything had been left about lobster boat
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96592-0013.wav,155244,once out of that room he could ran and by daylight the smugglers dare not hunt him down
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96592-0014.wav,605164,oh those bars he mentally exclaimed and he was advancing toward them when just as he drew near there was a rustling noise under the window a couple of hands seized the bars there was a scratching of boot toes against stone work and ram's face appeared to gaze into the room by intention but into the astonished countenance of the young midshipman instead
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96592-0015.wav,85164,ram was the first to recover from his surprise
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96592-0016.wav,66444,hullo he said who are you

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96592-0025.wav,109804,archy stepped back to the door listening but there was not a sound
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96592-0026.wav,154284,he has gone to give the alarm thought the prisoner and he looked excitedly round for a way of escape
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96592-0027.wav,81964,nothing but the chimney presented itself
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96592-0028.wav,397164,a happy inspiration had come and placing one hand upon his breast he thrust in the other gave a tug and drew out his little curved dirk glanced at the edge ran to the window and began to cut at one of the bars labour in vain
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96592-0029.wav,171884,he divided the paint and produced a few squeaks and grating sounds as he realised that the attempt was madness
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96592-0030.wav,500204,the result was not very satisfactory but sufficiently so to make him essay the bar of the window once more producing a grating ear assailing sound as he found that now he did make a little impression so little though that the probability was if he kept on working well for twenty four hours he would not get through
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96592-0031.wav,135724,but at the end of five minutes he stopped and thrust back the dirk into its sheath

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/7902-96592-0050.wav,245324,to his astonishment the boy did not flinch but thrust his own arms through placing them about the middy's waist clenching his hands behind and uttering a sharp whistle

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/3331-159609-0014.wav,907884,it was so tender earnest and defiant that fanny forgot the defence of her own lover in admiration of polly's loyalty to hers for this faithful all absorbing love was a new revelation to fanny who was used to hearing her friends boast of two or three lovers a year and calculate their respective values with almost as much coolness as the young men discussed the fortunes of the girls they wished for but could not afford to marry
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/3331-159609-0015.wav,217804,i hope maria bailey is all he thinks her she added softly for i could n't bear to have him disappointed again

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/3331-159609-0020.wav,739564,if fanny wanted to show him what she could do toward making a pleasant home she certainly succeeded better than she suspected for in spite of many failures and discouragements behind the scenes the little house became a most attractive place to mister sydney at least for he was more the house friend than ever and seemed determined to prove that change of fortune made no difference to him

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/3331-159609-0025.wav,248684,but if work baskets were gifted with powers of speech they could tell stories more true and tender than any we read

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/533-1066-0015.wav,299244,once only somebody spoke and then it was an emphatic bit of profanity from doctor stewart when he ran into a wire fence

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/533-1066-0023.wav,200844,a doctor is generally supposed to be handier at burying folks than at digging them up

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/533-131562-0003.wav,184044,now then sneered he we must have a confiscation of property
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/533-131562-0004.wav,137164,and putting the keys into his pocket he walked into the library
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/533-131562-0005.wav,178604,that and all replied the master and the things were cleared away

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/3997-180297-0006.wav,180364,because i am watched and the least suspicion might do me the greatest harm

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/3997-180297-0020.wav,247564,such a man i found in the duke but the duke is old and old age neither protects nor consoles

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0017.wav,268204,when he spoke of the mechanical powers he evidently looked upon them only as new ways of extending trade and making money
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0018.wav,409324,and the poor men around him they were poor because they were vicious out of the pale of his sympathies because they had not his iron nature and the capabilities that it gives him for being rich
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0019.wav,102124,not vicious he never said that
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0020.wav,114284,improvident and self indulgent were his words
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0021.wav,166764,margaret was collecting her mother's working materials and preparing to go to bed
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0022.wav,443724,just as she was leaving the room she hesitated she was inclined to make an acknowledgment which she thought would please her father but which to be full and true must include a little annoyance
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0023.wav,82764,however out it came
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0024.wav,288524,papa i do think mister thornton a very remarkable man but personally i don't like him at all
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0025.wav,108844,and i do said her father laughing
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0026.wav,114764,personally as you call it and all
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0027.wav,133164,i don't set him up for a hero or anything of that kind
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0028.wav,62124,but good night child
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0029.wav,145644,there were several other signs of something wrong about missus hale
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0030.wav,393644,she and dixon held mysterious consultations in her bedroom from which dixon would come out crying and cross as was her custom when any distress of her mistress called upon her sympathy
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0031.wav,537644,once margaret had gone into the chamber soon after dixon left it and found her mother on her knees and as margaret stole out she caught a few words which were evidently a prayer for strength and patience to endure severe bodily suffering
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0032.wav,539244,but though she received caresses and fond words back again in such profusion as would have gladdened her formerly yet she felt that there was a secret withheld from her and she believed it bore serious reference to her mother's health
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0033.wav,277964,she lay awake very long this night planning how to lessen the evil influence of their milton life on her mother
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0034.wav,485322,a servant to give dixon permanent assistance should be got if she gave up her whole time to the search and then at any rate her mother might have all the personal attention she required and had been accustomed to her whole life
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0035.wav,348844,visiting register offices seeing all manner of unlikely people and very few in the least likely absorbed margaret's time and thoughts for several days
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0036.wav,165324,one afternoon she met bessy higgins in the street and stopped to speak to her
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0037.wav,66444,well bessy how are you
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0038.wav,133484,better and not better if yo know what that means
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0039.wav,126124,not exactly replied margaret smiling
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0040.wav,641644,i'm better in not being torn to pieces by coughing o'nights but i'm weary and tired o milton and longing to get away to the land o beulah and when i think i'm farther and farther off my heart sinks and i'm no better i'm worse
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0041.wav,222124,margaret turned round to walk alongside of the girl in her feeble progress homeward
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0042.wav,104364,but for a minute or two she did not speak
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0043.wav,109644,at last she said in a low voice
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0044.wav,109004,bessy do you wish to die
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0045.wav,185964,bessy was silent in her turn for a minute or two then she replied
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0046.wav,89484,nought worse than many others i reckon
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0047.wav,56364,but what was it
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0048.wav,264044,you know i'm a stranger here so perhaps i'm not so quick at understanding what you mean as if i'd lived all my life at milton
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0049.wav,162604,i had forgotten what i said for the time continued margaret quietly
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0050.wav,174444,i should have thought of it again when i was less busy may i go with you now
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0051.wav,212044,the sharpness in her eye turned to a wistful longing as she met margaret's soft and friendly gaze
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0052.wav,226604,as they turned up into a small court opening out of a squalid street bessy said
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0053.wav,185964,yo'll not be daunted if father's at home and speaks a bit gruffish at first
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0054.wav,100524,but nicholas was not at home when they entered
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0055.wav,76524,gasped bessy at last
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0056.wav,217324,bessy took a long and feverish draught and then fell back and shut her eyes
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0057.wav,284364,margaret bent over and said bessy don't be impatient with your life whatever it is or may have been
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0058.wav,124364,remember who gave it you and made it what it is
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0059.wav,113964,now i'll not have my wench preached to
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0060.wav,313004,but surely said margaret facing round you believe in what i said that god gave her life and ordered what kind of life it was to be
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0061.wav,100204,i believe what i see and no more
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0062.wav,88844,that's what i believe young woman

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0066.wav,100364,but the girl only pleaded the more with margaret

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0071.wav,123724,she put her hand to it and became ghastly pale
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0072.wav,187244,margaret held her in her arms and put the weary head to rest upon her bosom
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/1688-142285-0073.wav,238764,presently the spasm that foreshadowed death had passed away and bessy roused herself and said

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28330-0009.wav,222284,his face froze with nervousness that this might not do as an answer and he stood stiff and still before captain blizzard
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28330-0010.wav,147084,the captain sat forward in his chair looking at him for a long moment considering
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28330-0011.wav,169644,then he said well i do not care for it i cannot say i do

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28330-0018.wav,213964,he then went on to describe what else was to follow the covering of the ship with leaves to make it blend with its surroundings
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28330-0019.wav,177484,camouflage was not a word the captain or anyone else of his time yet understood
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28330-0020.wav,135244,what can be said during that time sir chris thought to ask
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28330-0021.wav,189164,i am somewhat skilled in medicaments i have to be as captain of a ship and the crew know it

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28330-0023.wav,208844,not since he had left mister wicker had chris felt such confidence as he did in the words and actions of captain blizzard
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28330-0024.wav,211084,he knew now that his absence for as long as he had to be away would be covered up and satisfactorily accounted for
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28330-0025.wav,84044,their conversation had taken some little while
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28319-0000.wav,106604,the learning of magic was by no means easy

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28319-0002.wav,143724,chris therefore threw himself into all the preliminaries of his task
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28319-0003.wav,387884,one afternoon when he returned after a rest to mister wicker's study he saw that there was something new in the room a bowl with a goldfish in it stood on the table but mister wicker was not to be seen
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28319-0004.wav,73804,what shall i do first

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28319-0007.wav,143564,mister wicker waited patiently beside him for a few moments for chris to get up his courage
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28319-0008.wav,148684,then as nothing happened with a voice like a whip mister wicker said start at once
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28319-0009.wav,102762,the sensation spread faster and faster
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28319-0010.wav,155726,his head swam and he felt faint and a little sick but he persisted through the final words
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28319-0011.wav,374284,he thought not without a feeling of pride and commenced experimenting with his tail and fins with such enthusiasm and delight that some little time elapsed before mister wicker's voice boomed close by
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28319-0012.wav,111084,seventy four book one the return
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28319-0013.wav,174924,the figure's shoes carved in some eastern style had curved up pointing toes
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28319-0014.wav,91884,then all at once the idea came to chris
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28319-0015.wav,115244,if he was to be a magician could he make this boy come to life
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28319-0016.wav,293002,he squatted on his haunches examining the carved wooden figure attentively and felt convinced that once alive the boy would be an ideal and happy companion
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28319-0017.wav,93486,but how did one change inanimate to animate
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28319-0018.wav,95724,chris got up and stole back to mister wicker's door
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28319-0019.wav,431244,he heard the magician going up the spiral staircase to his room above and after changing himself to a mouse to slip under the door and see that the room was really empty chris resumed his proper shape and opened the doors of the cupboard at the far end of the room
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28319-0020.wav,110924,the afternoon rainy before increased in storm
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28319-0021.wav,155084,dusk came two hours before its time thunder snarled in the sky
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28319-0022.wav,118284,certain elements were to be mixed and poured at the proper time
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28319-0023.wav,318924,mister wicker began moving about upstairs the floorboards creaked and still chris could not leave until the potion fumed and glowed
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28319-0024.wav,224044,with infinite caution chris closed the door silently behind him and running lightly forward reached the figure of the negro boy
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28319-0025.wav,82604,it was as if the stiffness melted
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28319-0026.wav,323564,under his eyes the wooden folds of cloth became rich silk embroidery gleamed in its reality upon the coat and oh the face
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28319-0027.wav,307564,the wooden grin loosened the large eyes turned the hand holding the hard bouquet of carved flowers moved and let the bouquet fall

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28311-0001.wav,159404,chris looked from a nickel plated flashlight to a car jack and spark plug

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28311-0007.wav,181164,chris asked and for the first time that day the heavy weight he carried within him lifted and lightened a little
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28311-0008.wav,85484,think he really needs it he pursued
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28311-0009.wav,384364,he would have liked to get the job for jakey who needed it but somehow the task of facing mister wicker especially now that the light was going and dusk edging into the streets was not what chris had intended for ending the afternoon
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28311-0010.wav,181964,mike's expression changed at once to one of triumph but chris was only partly encouraged
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28311-0011.wav,107244,betcha aren't goin after all chris turned on him

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28311-0014.wav,210924,chris started off once more passing the bleak little victorian church perched on the hill above mister wicker's house
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28311-0015.wav,276044,an empty lot cut into by church lane gave a look of isolation to the l shaped brick building that served mister wicker as both house and place of business
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28311-0016.wav,460044,the longer wing toward the back had a back door that opened onto water street the space between the house and wisconsin avenue had been made into a neat oblong flower garden fenced off from the sidewalk by box shrubs and a white picket fence
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28311-0017.wav,179722,a livid yellow stained the horizon beyond the factories and gray clouds lowered and tumbled above
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28311-0018.wav,107726,the air was growing chill and chris decided to finish his job
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28311-0019.wav,155884,all at once he wondered how his mother was and everything in him pinched and tightened itself
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28311-0020.wav,86924,at the foot of the hill he reached the house
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28311-0021.wav,147884,there were three things that always caught his eye amid the litter of dusty pieces
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28311-0022.wav,400844,on the left the coil of rope in the center the model of a sailing ship in a green glass bottle and on the right the wooden statue of a negro boy in baggy trousers turkish jacket and white turban
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28311-0023.wav,233964,but the name still showed at the prow and many a time chris safe at home in bed had sailed imaginary voyages in the mirabelle
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28311-0024.wav,118444,he had never seen anyone go into mister wicker's shop now he thought of it
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28311-0025.wav,120524,how then did he live and what did he ever sell
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28311-0026.wav,87244,a sudden car horn woke him from his dream
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0000.wav,277964,of the many times he had examined mister wicker's window and pored over the rope the ship and the nubian boy he had never gone into mister wicker's shop
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0001.wav,202604,so now alone until someone should answer the bell he looked eagerly if uneasily around him
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0002.wav,181164,what with the one window and the lowering day outside the long narrow shop was somber
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0003.wav,129804,heavy hand hewn beams crossed it from one side to the other
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0004.wav,146764,mister wicker's back being toward the source of light chris could not see his face
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0005.wav,354604,the double fans of minute wrinkles breaking from eye corner to temple and joining with those over the cheekbones were drawn into the horizontal lines across the domed forehead
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0006.wav,377644,little tufts of white fuzz above the ears were all that remained of the antiquarian's hair but what drew and held chris's gaze were the old man's eyes
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0007.wav,131564,chris blinked and looked again yes they were still there
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0008.wav,119404,chris swallowed and his voice came back to him
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0009.wav,61324,yes sir he said
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0010.wav,117164,i saw your sign and i know a boy who needs the job

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0012.wav,115404,jakey harris his name is and he really needs the job
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0013.wav,121324,i i just wondered if the place was still open
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0014.wav,369324,what he saw was a fresh cheeked lad tall for thirteen sturdy with sincerity and good humor in his face and something sensitive and appealing about his eyes
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0015.wav,132524,he guessed there must be a lively fire in that room beyond
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0016.wav,133964,would that interfere with jakey's getting the job sir
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0017.wav,419404,but even as he slowly turned the thought pierced his mind why had he not seen the reflection of the headlights of the cars moving up around the corner of water street and up the hill toward the traffic signals
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0018.wav,85164,the room seemed overly still
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0019.wav,108364,then in that second he turned and faced about
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0020.wav,260044,the wide bow window was there before him the three objects he liked best showing frosty in the moonlight that poured in from across the water
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0021.wav,123884,across the water where was the freeway
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0022.wav,198124,it was no longer there nor were the high walls and smokestacks of factories to be seen
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0023.wav,60844,the warehouses were still there
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0024.wav,213964,flabbergasted and breathless chris was unaware that he had moved closer to peer out the window in every direction
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0025.wav,130124,no electric signs no lamplit streets
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0026.wav,227564,where the people's drugstore had stood but a half hour before rose the roofs of what was evidently an inn
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0027.wav,226284,a courtyard was sparsely lit by a flaring torch or two showing a swinging sign hung on a post
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0028.wav,139564,the post was planted at the edge of what was now a broad and muddy road
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0029.wav,186284,a coach with its top piled high with luggage stamped to a halt beside the flagged courtyard
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4852-28312-0030.wav,113004,they moved into the inn the coach rattled off to the stable

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63722-0027.wav,260044,maybe the fight was about who owned the watch for the dagos talked in their foreign lingo and none of the neighbors could tell what they were sayin i see

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63722-0036.wav,237324,that's right agreed the colonel as he continued to move his magnifying glass over the surface of the still ticking watch
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63722-0037.wav,349164,and a close observer might have observed that he did not touch his bare fingers to the timepiece but poked it about and touched it here and there with the end of a leadpencil
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63722-0038.wav,178924,and donovan take a friend's advice and don't be too free with that watch too free with it

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63722-0047.wav,207724,rather a hypothetical question colonel but i should say it might be a fifty fifty proposition
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63722-0048.wav,226764,at best he would get off with a scotch verdict of not proven but he doesn't want that nor do i

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63722-0059.wav,71724,and there's no reason you shouldn't know
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63723-0000.wav,200204,chuckled the colonel as he skilfully played the luckless trout now struggling to get loose from the hook
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63723-0001.wav,370924,and when the fish was landed panting on the grass and shag had been roused from his slumber to slip the now limp fish into the creel colonel ashley gave a sigh of relief and remarked i think i see it now
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63723-0002.wav,118124,the reason she asked no alimony inquired kenneth
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63723-0003.wav,71724,no i wasn't thinking of that

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63723-0007.wav,292044,it was one of what at first might be called refined cruelty on her husband's part degenerating gradually into that of the baser sort
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63723-0008.wav,237484,you don't mean that larch struck her that there was physical abuse do you asked the colonel that's what he did
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63723-0009.wav,114604,the colonel did not disclose the fact that it was no news to him
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63723-0010.wav,129164,aaron grafton's statement was being unexpectedly confirmed
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63723-0011.wav,128844,he remembered that cynthia and grafton had once been in love with each other
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63723-0012.wav,128204,she said he had struck her more than once and she could stand it no longer
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63723-0013.wav,75084,because larch made no defense
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63723-0014.wav,227564,larch by refusing to appear practically admitted the charges against him and did not oppose the separation
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63723-0015.wav,254124,so i had to let her have her way and we did not ask the court for money though i had no such squeamish feelings when it came to my counsel fee
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63723-0016.wav,177164,no but he will or i'll sue him and get judgment oh he'll pay all right
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63723-0017.wav,86124,and it takes all sorts of persons to make it up
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63723-0018.wav,78284,still i would like to know
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63723-0019.wav,257804,the murder of missus darcy had some time ago been shifted off the front page though it would get back there when the young jeweler was tried
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63723-0020.wav,89164,it had a double reputation so to speak
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63723-0021.wav,336684,grave and even reverend conventions assembled in its ballroom and politicians of the upper if not better class were frequently seen in its dining room or cafe
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63723-0022.wav,88844,larch himself was a peculiar character
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63723-0023.wav,97804,in a smaller place he would have been called a saloon keeper
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63723-0024.wav,189004,and it was this man rich it was said handsome certainly that cynthia ratchford had married
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63723-0025.wav,102604,to this was the answer whispered money
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63723-0026.wav,69644,and in a way it was true
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63723-0027.wav,164044,she also saw an opportunity of paying old debts and reaping some revenges
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63723-0028.wav,327084,after the marriage which was a brilliant and gay one if not happy the larch hotel it could hardly be called a home became the scene of many festive occasions
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63723-0029.wav,479564,then it was said of larch that soon after the echoes of the wedding chimes had died away he had begun to treat his wife with refined cruelty that hidden away from the public underneath his habitual manner there was the rawness of the brute
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63723-0030.wav,466764,but it was noticed that the older and more conservative families were less often represented and when they were it was by some of the younger members whose reputations were already smirched or who had not yet acquired any and were willing to take a chance
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63723-0031.wav,348204,it wouldn't do you know after that story came out for me and the vice chancellor who sat in the case as well as other judges and members of the bar to be seen there kenneth explained to the colonel
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63723-0032.wav,418444,meanwhile colonel ashley was a very busy man and to no one did he tell very much about his activities he saw darcy frequently at the jail and to that young man's pleadings that something be done always returned the answer
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63723-0033.wav,80364,don't worry it will come out all right
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63723-0034.wav,105004,i'm going to rectify them but it will take time
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63723-0035.wav,120684,it's hard for miss mason too although she's bearing up like a major
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63723-0036.wav,94924,so king got bail who put it up
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63723-0037.wav,76684,it was high larch
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63723-0038.wav,67724,they took harry away a while ago
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63723-0039.wav,99564,but his are pretty uncertain shoes to be in just the same
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6432-63723-0040.wav,133804,only that i darcy hesitated and grew red

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0001.wav,291884,my very good friend and excellent neighbor replied the count with a smile you really exaggerate my trifling exertions

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0015.wav,386284,i will confess to you albert replied franz the count is a very singular person and the appointment you have made to meet him in paris fills me with a thousand apprehensions
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0016.wav,105964,did you ever meet him previously to coming hither

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0018.wav,1076684,he dwelt with considerable force and energy on the almost magical hospitality he had received from the count and the magnificence of his entertainment in the grotto of the thousand and one nights he recounted with circumstantial exactitude all the particulars of the supper the hashish the statues the dream and how at his awakening there remained no proof or trace of all these events save the small yacht seen in the distant horizon driving under full sail toward porto vecchio
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0019.wav,583564,then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the colosseum between the count and vampa in which the count had promised to obtain the release of the bandit peppino an engagement which as our readers are aware he most faithfully fulfilled
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0020.wav,167404,but said franz the corsican bandits that were among the crew of his vessel
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0021.wav,113324,why really the thing seems to me simple enough
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0022.wav,640042,talking of countries replied franz of what country is the count what is his native tongue whence does he derive his immense fortune and what were those events of his early life a life as marvellous as unknown that have tinctured his succeeding years with so dark and gloomy a misanthropy
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0023.wav,148206,certainly these are questions that in your place i should like to have answered
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0024.wav,509644,my dear franz replied albert when upon receipt of my letter you found the necessity of asking the count's assistance you promptly went to him saying my friend albert de morcerf is in danger help me to deliver him
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0025.wav,176524,what are his means of existence what is his birthplace of what country is he a native
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0026.wav,511724,i confess he asked me none no he merely came and freed me from the hands of signor vampa where i can assure you in spite of all my outward appearance of ease and unconcern i did not very particularly care to remain
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0027.wav,333324,and this time it must be confessed that contrary to the usual state of affairs in discussions between the young men the effective arguments were all on albert's side
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-86744-0028.wav,267244,well said franz with a sigh do as you please my dear viscount for your arguments are beyond my powers of refutation

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/6070-63485-0004.wav,541804,in an instant the schoolmaster with a leap resembling in strength and agility the spring of a tiger seized seyton with one hand by the throat and exclaimed your money or i will fling you into this hole

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/2414-159411-0004.wav,465324,then the brahman took pity on him and opened the cage door but no sooner had he done so than the tiger jumping out said now i will eat you first and drink the water afterwards
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/2414-159411-0005.wav,431404,so the brahman and the tiger walked on till they came to a banyan tree and the brahman said to it banyan tree banyan tree hear and give judgment

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/2414-159411-0017.wav,220204,then the tiger began to roar and said the judgment of all is against you o brahman
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/2414-159411-0018.wav,280524,after this they saw an alligator and the brahman related the matter to him hoping for a more favorable verdict
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/2414-159411-0019.wav,270924,but the alligator said whenever i put my nose out of the water men torment me and try to kill me
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/2414-159411-0020.wav,350444,the brahman gave himself up as lost but again he prayed the tiger to have patience and let him ask the opinion of the sixth judge
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/2414-159411-0021.wav,79724,now the sixth was a jackal
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/2414-159411-0022.wav,312684,the brahman told his story and said to him uncle jackal uncle jackal say what is your judgment

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0001.wav,92846,before her he decided to scatter his pearls
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0002.wav,158284,the princess was distracted and did not know what to do she felt she had sinned against kitty

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0005.wav,100684,as you please the princess went out with a sigh
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0006.wav,113644,the family doctor respectfully ceased in the middle of his observations
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0007.wav,128204,and there are indications malnutrition nervous excitability and so on
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0008.wav,199884,the question stands thus in presence of indications of tuberculous process what is to be done to maintain nutrition

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0014.wav,108044,what is wanted is means of improving nutrition and not for lowering it
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0015.wav,109804,the family doctor listened attentively and respectfully
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0016.wav,200844,but in favor of foreign travel i would urge the change of habits the removal from conditions calling up reminiscences
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0017.wav,73964,and then the mother wishes it he added
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0018.wav,146444,ah well in that case to be sure let them go only those german quacks are mischievous
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0019.wav,86764,oh time's up already and he went to the door
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0020.wav,251244,the celebrated doctor announced to the princess a feeling of what was due from him dictated his doing so that he ought to see the patient once more
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0021.wav,133644,oh no only a few details princess come this way
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0022.wav,132844,and the mother accompanied by the doctor went into the drawing room to kitty
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0023.wav,133804,when the doctor came in she flushed crimson and her eyes filled with tears
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0024.wav,108684,she answered him and all at once got up furious
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0025.wav,98924,excuse me doctor but there is really no object in this
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0026.wav,87884,this is the third time you've asked me the same thing
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0027.wav,86284,the celebrated doctor did not take offense
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0028.wav,189964,nervous irritability he said to the princess when kitty had left the room however i had finished
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0029.wav,337964,and the doctor began scientifically explaining to the princess as an exceptionally intelligent woman the condition of the young princess and concluded by insisting on the drinking of the waters which were certainly harmless
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0030.wav,202924,at the question should they go abroad the doctor plunged into deep meditation as though resolving a weighty problem
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0031.wav,248364,finally his decision was pronounced they were to go abroad but to put no faith in foreign quacks and to apply to him in any need
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0032.wav,135564,it seemed as though some piece of good fortune had come to pass after the doctor had gone
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-10919-0033.wav,156044,the mother was much more cheerful when she went back to her daughter and kitty pretended to be more cheerful
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0000.wav,218764,educated people of the upper classes are trying to stifle the ever growing sense of the necessity of transforming the existing social order
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0001.wav,65964,this is absolutely incorrect
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0002.wav,297964,in the social conception of life it is supposed that since the aim of life is found in groups of individuals individuals will voluntarily sacrifice their own interests for the interests of the group
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0003.wav,295884,the champions of the social conception of life usually try to connect the idea of authority that is of violence with the idea of moral influence but this connection is quite impossible
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0004.wav,141324,the man who is controlled by moral influence acts in accordance with his own desires
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0005.wav,82124,the basis of authority is bodily violence
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0006.wav,260524,the possibility of applying bodily violence to people is provided above all by an organization of armed men trained to act in unison in submission to one will
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0007.wav,152204,these bands of armed men submissive to a single will are what constitute the army
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0008.wav,113164,the army has always been and still is the basis of power
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0009.wav,446444,power is always in the hands of those who control the army and all men in power from the roman caesars to the russian and german emperors take more interest in their army than in anything and court popularity in the army knowing that if that is on their side their power is secure
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0010.wav,73164,indeed it could not be otherwise
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0011.wav,119884,only under those conditions could the social organization be justified
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0012.wav,341324,but since this is not the case and on the contrary men in power are always far from being saints through the very fact of their possession of power the social organization based on power has no justification
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0013.wav,493004,even if there was once a time when owing to the low standard of morals and the disposition of men to violence the existence of an authority to restrain such violence was an advantage because the violence of government was less than the violence of individuals one cannot but see that this advantage could not be lasting
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0014.wav,279884,between the members of one state subject to a single authority the strife between individuals seems still less and the life of the state seems even more secure
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0015.wav,206124,it was produced on one hand by the natural growth of population and on the other by struggle and conquest
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0016.wav,239084,after conquest the power of the emperor puts an end to internal dissensions and so the state conception of life justifies itself
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0017.wav,90444,but this justification is never more than temporary
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0018.wav,227084,internal dissensions disappear only in proportion to the degree of oppression exerted by the authority over the dissentient individuals
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0019.wav,375084,government authority even if it does suppress private violence always introduces into the life of men fresh forms of violence which tend to become greater and greater in proportion to the duration and strength of the government
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0020.wav,237484,and therefore the oppression of the oppressed always goes on growing up to the furthest limit beyond which it cannot go without killing the goose with the golden eggs
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0021.wav,306124,the most convincing example of this is to be found in the condition of the working classes of our epoch who are in reality no better than the slaves of ancient times subdued by conquest
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0022.wav,58604,so it has always been
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0023.wav,304044,footnote the fact that in america the abuses of authority exist in spite of the small number of their troops not only fails to disprove this position but positively confirms it
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0024.wav,316524,the upper classes know that an army of fifty thousand will soon be insufficient and no longer relying on pinkerton's men they feel that the security of their position depends on the increased strength of the army
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0025.wav,548204,the reason to which he gave expression is essentially the same as that which made the french kings and the popes engage swiss and scotch guards and makes the russian authorities of to day so carefully distribute the recruits so that the regiments from the frontiers are stationed in central districts and the regiments from the center are stationed on the frontiers
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0026.wav,329644,the meaning of caprivi's speech put into plain language is that funds are needed not to resist foreign foes but to buy under officers to be ready to act against the enslaved toiling masses
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0027.wav,97484,and this abnormal order of things is maintained by the army
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0028.wav,335564,but there is not only one government there are other governments exploiting their subjects by violence in the same way and always ready to pounce down on any other government and carry off the fruits of the toil of its enslaved subjects
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0029.wav,141484,and so every government needs an army also to protect its booty from its neighbor brigands
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0030.wav,135884,this increase is contagious as montesquieu pointed out one hundred fifty years ago
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0031.wav,309484,every increase in the army of one state with the aim of self defense against its subjects becomes a source of danger for neighboring states and calls for a similar increase in their armies
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0032.wav,278764,the despotism of a government always increases with the strength of the army and its external successes and the aggressiveness of a government increases with its internal despotism
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0033.wav,421484,the rivalry of the european states in constantly increasing their forces has reduced them to the necessity of having recourse to universal military service since by that means the greatest possible number of soldiers is obtained at the least possible expense
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0034.wav,229964,and by this means all citizens are under arms to support the iniquities practiced upon them all citizens have become their own oppressors
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0035.wav,124044,this inconsistency has become obvious in universal military service
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0036.wav,432844,in fact the whole significance of the social conception of life consists in man's recognition of the barbarity of strife between individuals and the transitoriness of personal life itself and the transference of the aim of life to groups of persons
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0037.wav,381804,but with universal military service it comes to pass that men after making every sacrifice to get rid of the cruelty of strife and the insecurity of existence are called upon to face all the perils they had meant to avoid
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0038.wav,249644,but instead of doing that they expose the individuals to the same necessity of strife substituting strife with individuals of other states for strife with neighbors
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0039.wav,220044,the taxes raised from the people for war preparations absorb the greater part of the produce of labor which the army ought to defend
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0040.wav,201004,the danger of war ever ready to break out renders all reforms of life social life vain and fruitless
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0041.wav,270924,but the fatal significance of universal military service as the manifestation of the contradiction inherent in the social conception of life is not only apparent in that
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0042.wav,150924,governments assert that armies are needed above all for external defense but that is not true
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0043.wav,329004,they are needed principally against their subjects and every man under universal military service becomes an accomplice in all the acts of violence of the government against the citizens without any choice of his own
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0044.wav,77964,and for the sake of what am i making them
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0045.wav,275884,i am expected for the sake of the state to make these sacrifices to renounce everything that can be precious to man peace family security and human dignity
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0046.wav,197324,except for the state they say we should be exposed to the attacks of evil disposed persons in our own country
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0047.wav,227084,we know now that threats and punishments cannot diminish their number that that can only be done by change of environment and moral influence
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0048.wav,313324,so that the justification of state violence on the ground of the protection it gives us from evil disposed persons even if it had some foundation three or four centuries ago has none whatever now
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0049.wav,203404,except for the state they tell us we should not have any religion education culture means of communication and so on

/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0051.wav,110924,this argument too was well founded only some centuries ago
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0052.wav,393484,the great extension of means of communication and interchange of ideas has made men completely able to dispense with state aid in forming societies associations corporations and congresses for scientific economic and political objects
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0053.wav,104204,without governments nations would be enslaved by their neighbors
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0054.wav,174444,the government they tell us with its army is necessary to defend us from neighboring states who might enslave us
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0055.wav,245644,and if defense against barbarous nations is meant one thousandth part of the troops now under arms would be amply sufficient for that purpose
/lms/users/jubang/proj/LTAsr/data/LibriSpeech/test-other-wav/4350-9170-0056.wav,255244,the power of the state far from being a security against the attacks of our neighbors exposes us on the contrary to much greater danger of such attacks
